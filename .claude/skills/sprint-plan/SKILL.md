When this skill is invoked:

1. **Read the current milestone** from `production/milestones/`.

2. **Read the previous sprint** (if any) from `production/sprints/` to
   understand velocity and carryover.

3. **Scan design documents** in `design/gdd/` and `Specs/` for features
   tagged as ready for implementation.

4. **Check TODOS.md** for any tracked tasks.

For `new`:

5. **Generate a sprint plan** following this format:

```markdown
# Sprint [N] -- [Start Date] to [End Date]

## Sprint Goal
[One sentence describing what this sprint achieves toward the milestone]

## Capacity
- Total days: [X]
- Buffer (20%): [Y days reserved for unplanned work]
- Available: [Z days]

## Tasks

### Must Have (Critical Path)
| ID | Task | Agent/Owner | Est. Days | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

### Should Have
| ID | Task | Agent/Owner | Est. Days | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

### Nice to Have
| ID | Task | Agent/Owner | Est. Days | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|

## Carryover from Previous Sprint
| Task | Reason | New Estimate |
|------|--------|-------------|

## Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|

## Definition of Done for this Sprint
- [ ] All Must Have tasks completed
- [ ] All tasks pass acceptance criteria
- [ ] No S1 or S2 bugs in delivered features
- [ ] Design documents updated for any deviations
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
```

For `status`:

5. **Generate a status report** showing completed, in-progress, not started, and blocked tasks.

### Agent Consultation

For comprehensive sprint planning, consider consulting:
- `producer` agent for capacity planning and risk assessment
- `game-designer` agent for feature prioritization
